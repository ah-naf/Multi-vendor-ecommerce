# Assumptions made due to incomplete designs
I didn't have any idea about how the order status update UI will look like. I went throught some design in dribble and behance and tried to take some idea from multiple design.
Profile page uses shadcn tabs in figma design. I tried to render all the section in one page as handling with tabs making it more complex to handle for each section.

I think rest of the features was already given in the figma file.
